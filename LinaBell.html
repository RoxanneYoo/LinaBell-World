                    <p>Hello,my name is Liu Lujie, and my student number is 23467649.
                       I chose LinaBell as my website topic mainly because LinaBell has always 
                       been my favorite Disney character and one of Disney's popular IPs. 
                       She is very lively and cute, and her popularity and recognition 
                       make her an absolute must-have to attract a wide audience.

                    <p>LinaBell is an IP image released by Shanghai Disney on September 29, 2021. In the Disney story,

                       On the surface, this is a pink stuffed fox girl with big starry blue eyes and a big, fluffy fox tail.
                       On her adventures, she uses her signature magnifying glass and always 
                       finds accomplishment and joy in solving problems and unraveling mysteries. Meanwhile, LinaBell loves

                        One day, Mickey and Duffy were walking in the forest. And a group of colorful butterflies flew towards me. 
                        Daffy got separated from Mickey while chasing a beautiful butterfly. Daffy is frustrated not knowing where he is or how to find Mickey. 
                        At this time, the pink fox girl in the forest happened to pass by and saw the frowning Duffy.
                        She walked up to Duffy and asked, "What's wrong with you?".
                        "I'm lost and can't get back to Mickey..." Daffy said.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p> The fox girl picked up her magnifying glass and looked at Daffy carefully.
                        "Butterfly...orchid. That's it! I know where it is. I'll take you back." The fox girl who solved the mystery said confidently.
                        "Really? You are so awesome!" Duffy turned her worries into joy.
                        Daffy, who reunited with Mickey, said happily: "This fox girl is really smart!"
                        The fox girl then introduced herself: "I am Lina Bell. My hobby is solving puzzles!"
                        Finally, Duffy gave the orchid to Lina Bell as a small thank you.
